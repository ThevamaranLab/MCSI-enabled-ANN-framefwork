This repository provides everything you need to reproduce our workflow:

MCSI calculation – Matlab scripts that compute multi‑component shape invariants from images of hexagonally packed cylindrical, concentric‑cylindrical, and fractal architectures (pattern‑generation scripts are included).

Experimental data processing – Raw measurements, plus scripts that organize the data by architecture and derive the relevant mechanical properties.

Model training – A ready‑to‑use dataset and an ANN optimisation script for training and evaluating the model.
